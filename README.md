## Key Objectives of this project
- The main goal is to build a **containerized command line tool** that converts **csv files to json**
- I have built a tool that takes a Hugging Face dataset as a link, cleans it automatically, and exports the file as a json locally to your system

## Setup Authentication
- In order to pull my image from Docker Hub, you may need to log into docker. I suggest placing your authentication key in your **Codespace Secrets** section for ease of access
